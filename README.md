# Description

help-i-am-bored is a boredom relief application. Our team wanted to create something that incorporated the Bored API and Open Library API's into an application that generates recommendations for someone who is bored. The app provides a persistent note textarea, that is saved in local storage. A user can take note on the generated book and activity boredom relief suggestions. The notes can subsequently be downloaded to the users local machine. In the future, there is potential to incorporate more API's to provide the user a greater breadth of boredom solutions.
